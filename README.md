This app pulls from multiple API sources to combine weather and user input to generate playlists pulled from Spotify

# UserStory

As a user, I want to be able to play music based on what genres I am most interested in at the time of use.
I also want to be able to play music which genres correlate to the weather in my area.
Then I want to be able to save the playlists generated specifically for me onto my personal spotify page.
